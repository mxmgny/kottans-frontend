# General Basics
### 0.Git and GitHub
  **I always noticed poeple using Git and GitHub around me, but never dive into it by myself. Well, it was tough enough, what I didn't       expect. When i finished the course I understand how I was wrong about Git. It is really useful when you have bad habit of messing the     code I hope Git and GitHub improve my skills and implement all my ideas.**

## 1.Linux CLI, and HTTP
 **This course gave me some more substansional knowledge about command line and how to use it. I have tried to dive into it a year ago, but I didn't have much courage and persistence so I gave up. Starting from the scratch CLI topic i got solid foundational knowledge that will help me to master command line. 
 Talking about HTTP I already read the MDN HTTP docs, so those articles were a good reminder what I have already learned about it so far in MDN. 
 The one thing I was surprised is Nano. It' so simple and cool, I really enjoyed discovering it.**

## 2.Git Collaboration
**This part was not very difficult but it was like a reminder of first step. So I already knew everything in this course except flags for git commands that helps a lot.**

## 3.Intro to HTML and CSS
**Since 9-10 school grade, I've been repeating this course once a year at least on codecademy or w3school or FreeCodeCamp. So this part wasn't new to me but remind me about everything I already know about HTML and CSS. I really enjoyed HTML Academy course, i like their idea of test at the end of every chapter and how they implement it. The whole task was a bit boring, but useful**

## 4.Responsive Web Design
**This course is very important to understand how you should think of the flexible smartphone-friendly website and taught me the basics of flexbox in HTML. I was didn't know for example, that any interaction item on the smartphone screen must be at least 48px size. Flexbox is a very powerful tool and convenient tool to make responsive websites. So I will surely use it in my future projects   **
