### 0.Git and GitHub
  **I always noticed poeple using Git and GitHub around me, but never dive into it by myself. Well, it was tough enough, what I didn't       expect. When i finished the course I understand how I was wrong about Git. It is really useful when you have bad habit of messing the     code I hope Git and GitHub improve my skills and implement all my ideas.**
