### 0.Git and GitHub
  **I always noticed poeple using Git and GitHub around me, but never dive into it by myself. Well, it was tough enough, what I didn't       expect. When i finished the course I understand how I was wrong about Git. It is really useful when you have bad habit of messing the     code I hope Git and GitHub improve my skills and implement all my ideas.**

## 1.Linux CLI, and HTTP
 **This course gave me some more substansional knowledge about command line and how to use it. I have tried to dive into it a year ago, but I didn't have much courage and persistence so I gave up. Starting from the scratch CLI topic i got solid foundational knowledge that will help me to master command line. 
 Talking about HTTP I already read the MDN HTTP docs, so those articles were a good reminder what I have already learned about it so far in MDN. 
 The one thing I was surprised is Nano. It' so simple and cool, I really enjoyed discovering it.**
